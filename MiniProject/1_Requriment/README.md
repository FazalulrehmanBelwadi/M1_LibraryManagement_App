# **LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

## INTRODUCTION:

A Library management system is software that is designed to manage all the functions of a library. It helps librarian to maintain the database of new books and the books that are borrowed by members along with their due dates.

This system completely automates all your library’s activities. The best way to maintain, organize, and handle countless books systematically is to implement a library management system.

A library management system is used to maintain library records. It tracks the records of the number of books in the library, how many books are issued, or how many books have been returned or renewed or late fine charges, etc.

You can find books in an instant, issue/reissue books quickly, and manage all the data efficiently and orderly using this system. The Project  library management system is to provide instant and accurate data regarding any type of book, thereby saving a lot of time and effort.

## OBJECTIVES:

1) To build a system that can receive input and generate automatically output in easy way and short time.

2) To build a monitoring system that is able to monitor and manage all library operations efficiently.

3) Give an opportunity to librarians to reduce mistakes that always happen during manual method.

4) To store properly the library items in order to maintain their security.

5) To enter and preserve details of the various issues and keep a track on their returns.

## **4W'S and 1H:**

### Who
This Library Management System is an application is used by all the students, and staff who are having id's.

### What:
Library Management Systems is software that helps to maintain a database that is useful to enter new books & record books borrowed by the members, with the respective submission dates.

### When:
This Library Management System is very useful when there are large no of readers visit library to return, renewal, or take books. It is very tedious to enter the records manually so here this project come into handy.

### Where:
The Library management system is nowadays essential for schools, colleges, private libraries, and other organizations. They can use this software as the purpose of books issuing and returning for renewal.

### How:
This project is implemented to do the book issuing, retunrn, or renewal purpose by entering the student or faculty id as input.

## **Swot Analysis:**

### Strengths:
1) Simple & Easy to Use.

2) Increased Efficiency of Library Engagement.

3) Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable. 

4) Remote Access.

### Weakness:
1) Leak of data due cyber hack 

2) Costly and Expensive.

3) Difficult operation due to complexity of system

4) Requirement of High speed Internet connectivity.

## Opportunities:
 Library opportunities may present themselves in "economic, political/legal, technological, or sociocultural environments," Furthermore, it is likely that the future of library systems will consist of a mixture of open and closed systems as well as local and shared (or hosted) services. With an increasing move towards closed platforms (like Facebook, for example) and proprietary ecosystems (like Apple), libraries will be required tonavigate these different spaces and ecosystems.

### Threats:
Libraries now send and retrieve data from databases to help better manage inventory and the like, but some libraries don’t have the right data encryption practices in place. This can often lead to lost data and sometimes, the data easily obtainable by criminals.
